# Temperature-Prediction-Using-LSTM
This repository contains a deep learning model built using TensorFlow to predict future temperatures based on historical weather data. The model leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to capture temporal dependencies in the data.

## Overview
Accurately predicting weather plays a crucial role in planning and decision-making processes. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques to forecast the next dayâ€™s temperature using historical weather data. The LSTM model is trained to identify patterns in the data and provide precise temperature predictions.

## Tech Stack
The project uses the following tools and libraries:

- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **Data Processing and Visualization**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- **Web Framework**: Flask
